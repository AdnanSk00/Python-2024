for i in range(744):
    pass


# pass is used to leave that loop and work ahead

i = 0
while(i<44):
    # print(i,end=" ")
    print(f"{i}.",end=" ")

    i += 1;


# NOTE :- If I have to make for loop but I want to written code inside for loop later, so in this situation I will write 'pass' in for loop and will leave it and go ahead.
